<h4>Week dedicated to the interpretation and composition with percussive instruments in the field of contemporary music</h4>
<h5>From 23rd to 26th January, 2020</h5>

Avidi Lumi presents the first edition of educational activity dedicated to the study and analysis of the various aspects of contemporary music, focusing on percussive instruments and their use in musical composition.<br>
<br>
The formative proposal includes a workshop from 23rd to 26th  January 2020, which offers two sections:

<ul>
<li>Percussive instruments masterclass about the performance practice of contemporary soloist, electronic and electro-acoustic repertoire;
<li>Call for scores.
</ul>

The percussionist Simone Beneventi was invited for this first edition.<br>
<br>
The need to have these two sections is born to relate the compositional aspect, the research aspect and its realization in score for performers and musicians who searches the composer's idea inspiration. Participants will be able to work on the material proposed by the teacher, or on the choosen composers' music.<br>
<br>
The <strong>call for scores</strong> will determine 5 composers who will work with Simone Beneventi and the students of the instrumental course. The compositions of the participants will be selected for the <strong>final concert</strong> of the masterclass.<br>
<br>
To seal the offer, the Avidi Lumi studio provides its staff and electronic equipment, with the aim of carrying out practical workshops on amplification methods and performing of percussive and electronic pieces.<br>
<br>
On the evening of January 26th,  the end of the educational event will take place through the performance of the selected compositions and proposed works (soloists or ensembles) in the masterclass, performed by Simone Beneventi and the students.<br>
<br>
Registrations are also open to audience students subject to availability (max 15 per course).<br>
